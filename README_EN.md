# Hi, I'm Fer 👋👨‍💻 

## ✍️ About me

Welcome to my Github! I love tinkering with all kinds of technology. For the past 6 years, I've been focused on mobile development (Apps). Along with my best friend, I founded a company focused on this sector called rudo apps (https://rudo.es). We started with 4 people a few years ago and now we are a lot more (60 people), and our goal is to be the best in Spain in this field. Too ambitious? Maybe, but what is life without challenges?

We work hand in hand with large companies, some of them from the IBEX 35, to help create their products.

## 👀 What you can find here
